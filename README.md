## Features

- **Support for Renesas RH850**: Tailored for the RH850 microcontroller family, ensuring compatibility and performance.
- **Automotive BSW Structure**: Organized into modular Basic Software (BSW) layers, allowing for easy integration into existing systems.
- **EEPROM Abstraction**: Provides wrapper drivers for simplified EEPROM operations, making data storage and retrieval straightforward.
- **Flash Programming**: Includes tools and scripts for managing and programming Flash memory, essential for firmware updates.
- **Bootloader Core**: Supports UDS (ISO 14229) diagnostics and CAN interface, facilitating communication and troubleshooting.
- **Demo Application**: Comes with an example application for evaluation and integration, helping developers get started quickly.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
BSW/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Eep/         # EEPROM driver abstraction
  â”œâ”€â”€ Flash/       # Flash programming driver and build scripts
  â””â”€â”€ Fbl/         # Bootloader core and hardware abstraction
Demo/
  â””â”€â”€ DemoAppl/    # Demo application for evaluation
```

### BSW Directory

- **Eep/**: Contains the EEPROM driver abstraction, allowing for easy interaction with EEPROM components.
- **Flash/**: Holds the Flash programming driver along with build scripts for compiling and deploying the bootloader.
- **Fbl/**: This is the core of the bootloader, implementing hardware abstraction and communication protocols.

### Demo Directory

- **DemoAppl/**: Features a demo application that showcases the capabilities of the bootloader, making it easier to understand how to implement it in real-world scenarios.

## Installation

To get started with the Flashbootloader, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaronAlviar/SIP_Vector_Flashbootloader_RH850_Generic.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SIP_Vector_Flashbootloader_RH850_Generic
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, such as a compatible compiler for the RH850 family.
4. **Build the Project**: Use the provided build scripts in the Flash directory to compile the bootloader.

## Usage

Once the project is built, you can use the bootloader in your automotive ECU project. Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to implement it:

1. **Integrate the BSW Layers**: Include the necessary BSW modules in your ECU project.
2. **Configure the Bootloader**: Adjust settings in the configuration files to match your specific hardware and requirements.
3. **Use the Demo Application**: The demo application can serve as a reference. Modify it as needed to fit your use case.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the bootloader:

```c
#include "Fbl/bootloader.h"

int main(void) {
    Bootloader_Init();
    // Further initialization and main loop
    while (1) {
        Bootloader_MainLoop();
    }
}
```
